# DisGloss

One of my wonderful [friends](https://github.com/Reillyhewitson) hates acronyms. This led to our Discord server having a glossary channel, this channel became unusable within about 10 hours of it's existance. This bot simplifies the process by bonking users who use unexpanded acornyms and expanding acronyms on demand. 

## AI is taking over
> Is this partly a passive aggressive way to get my friend to stop complaining about acronyms? Yes. Am I ashamed of that? No. Am I ashamed of the fact that I'm using a README to vent about my friend? Yes. Is this written in a way that makes it seem like I'm talking to myself? Yes. Is that a problem? No. Is this a good way to spend my time? No. Do I care? No. Please help me.

I was going to write a short message there about being passive aggressive but copilot wanted to just keep going and as such I let it. I do not regret this decision.
